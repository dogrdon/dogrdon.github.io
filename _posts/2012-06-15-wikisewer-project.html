<p>Wikisewer is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/edsu/wikistream">Wikistream</a>. Being intriquiged by digital ephemera, I took this opportunity to start collecting instances of Wikipedia vandalism, which - when caught - gets promptly removed from the record.</p>

<p>This project, like Wikistream, monitors the recent changes wikipedia irc channel and then scrapes the pages identified as having some vandalism on them. It collects the date and time, the information for the wikipedia page, and the content of the vandalism and stores it in mongodb.</p>
