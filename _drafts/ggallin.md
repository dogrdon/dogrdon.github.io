Notes: I was going to use this opportunity to write some bizarre story about GG Allin and his last day on earth. But I am a consumate failure when it comes to putting together an interesting story about anything. 

So I had to dig deeper into my fascination about this topic and realized that it is in the story telling made available by "archival footage", (though it's not archival footage if no one is actually archiving it).

So this is about the archive, and keeping stories and placing documents in their cultural significance and what we can do when there is very little support for archiving documents that perhaps fall a bit to far under the threshold for "collecting".

On youtube there is an increasing number of videos taped of GG Allin, a nihilistic punk rock musician who died of a heroin overdose in 1993. 

GG Allin is a complicated individual and I don't think it's controversial to say that he is significant enough to document. Plenty of folks did in the 80s and 90s. And today these videos are surfacing. 

There are a few "archives" online of GG Allin footage. More famously, Todd Phillips, the dropout NYU film student and the director of the Hangover movies got his start following GG around and filming him for a well-known documentary "Hated".

GG Allin is not unknown, and he certainly not unnoteworthy. But he's more infamous than famous.

This isn't about who he is, really. I don't know, but it is about the documentation of a time. Particularly a milieu that... 

* can you imagine if gg allin had a cellphone?
