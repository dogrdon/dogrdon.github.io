description: "In a the last post, I detailed the motivation, approach, and challenges of collecting native advertising or suggested content on popular websites. In this post I explore the data collected and conclude with some remarks on observations, potential insights, and problems or shortcomings involved. Ultimately this remains an experiment and will not longer be pursued. The data can be accessed by others if they might be interested"

### Recap

Last month I finished pulling ads from across the web. You can see the process [here](link). While the data were not collecting in a scientific fashion, I still wanted to take the opportunity to explore it a bit and see what we'd gathered.

[Some prelimninary questions]

### Exploratory Analysis

Things to review: 

- Some common items like common headlines, group by political affiliation and explore trends there
- Explore trends over time
- Do some image exploration 
    - Common image patterns - classify by a few buckets (gross, adult, food, person, car/plane)
    - Which types of images happen most on which types of sites
    - Most common image patterns
    - Least common image

### Conclusion

- Since data collection here was so stop and go and evolved over time, the results above are pretty unscientific.
- The most compelling piece was the images
- Could go deeper with political affiliation, but perhaps that might be a bit of a fishing expedition. One I am no longer up for with this project
- Could have done more with timeseries, but collection was so inconsistent for many reasons
    - for some reason main scraper could not reach revcontent ads, so had to supplement
    - using proxies did not work
    - changing servers did not work
    - using headless chrome did not work
