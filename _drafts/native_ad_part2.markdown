description: "In a the last post, I detailed the motivation, approach, and challenges of collecting native advertising or suggested content on popular websites. In this post I explore the data collected and conclude with some remarks on observations, potential insights, and problems or shortcomings involved. Ultimately this remains an experiment and will not longer be pursued. The data can be accessed by others if they might be interested"

### Conclusion

- could have done more with timeseries, but collection was so inconsistent for many reasons
    - for some reason main scraper could not reach revcontent ads, so had to supplement
    - using proxies did not work
    - changing servers did not work
    - using headless chrome did not work
