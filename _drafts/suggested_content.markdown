title: "Recommended Content on the Web Pt. 1: The Web is not an API"
description: "Suggested content on the web, often ignored or blocked, is at the same time ubiquitous and unseen. Often the most mundane pieces of information can take on a different value when aggregated, explored, and understood outside of their original context. This post details how I originally sought to take on an approach at collecting, analyzing, and reconstituting the clickbait, suggested web articles that accompany most commercial, high traffic web sites, but found out soon that the web is fragile, unpredictable, and definitlely not your API if you want to treat it's content like a source of reliable data."

### What is it?

Suggestions from native ad networks like Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent, Content.Ad, Adblade, AdsWift, SiteAd, ContentBling (Some are made up, can you guess which) often serve the purpose of connecting site users with interesting articles or 'content' on other web domains. 

They also provide access to other articles on the same site, but we are not interested in those for this study. 

Often the content is arbitrary, false, or otherwise meant almost exclusively to get the user to click on them without regard for the quality, value, or existential merit of the target content.

[Examples]

These services operate by providing their clients a source of ad revenue. And so the content is engineered to maximize numbers of clicks.

[How does this stuff actually work?] 

### Why it's interesting

#### "CONTENT"

- what goes into content, all the various components


### What did I do?

1. scraped selected websites with know "suggested content" on them for 30 days, the more absurd, the better
2. 1 purpose: wanted to work with web archiving of fragments - Developed a process for "archiving this content"
3. 2 purpose: Wanted to make the resource available to others (for research?) e.g., what content comes up at what times (correlation with news stories?)

[Yes but WHY?]

#### PRESENTATION, INVITING OTHERS
- An exhibit resource (gallery) drawing connections btw items. Ways to grab subjects or topic modeling for things (food, celebrities, health, crime, sex, sex)
- A microcosm of the internet itself, the extreme end if "content". This is the distilled result of these companies best guess of what will draw attention.
- "As a discourse, it's watching machines and reptilian minded marketing initiatives talking to sometime the interests of a specific user (cookies) or perhaps the basest desires of a composite sketch of your average web user."
- probably have a little bit of analysis on what is already there (PT.2)
- provide access to data
- Gaps in web archiving, ephemera trash the absurd boundaries of knowledge and information


### Some main challenges:

- The web is still not a good API, and content does not abide by much of a standard (the web is shit), "content" is destroying our chances at this
- PhantomJS is great, but has issues
- Sites and content providers are finicky, they change their layout, they change native ad services regularly. It's hard to keep up with it.

### Where to next?

- Understand content on a site per site basis or across sites?
- Image analysis, are these images in possession of some clickbaitability?
- Plumbing the evil depths (what happens when you get robots to click on the clicks)
- capture cookie information as part of the SIP
- would want to analyze how these services differ between each other and how they themselves change over time
- ontology of suggested content
- how it makes web pages bloated (way to visualize)
