title: "Understanding Recommended Content on the Web Pt. 1"
description: "Suggested content on the web, often ignored or blocked, is at the sametime ubiquitous and unseen. Often the most mundane pieces of information can take on a different value when aggregated, explored, and understood outside of their original context. This post takes an approach at collecting, analyzing, and reconstituting the clickbait, suggested web articles that accompany most commercial, high traffic web sites."

### What is it?

Suggestions from native ad networks like Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent, and Adblade often serve the purpose of connecting site users with interesting articles or 'content' on other web domains. They also provide access to other articles on the same site, but we are not interested in those for this study. Often the content is arbitrary, false, or otherwise meant almost exclusively to get the user to click on them, without regard for the quality or value of the target content.

[Examples]

These services operate by providing their clients a source of ad revenue. And so the content is engineered to maximize numbers of clicks.

[How does this stuff actually work?] 

### Why it's interesting

#### "CONTENT"

- ontology of suggested content
- what goes into content, all the various components, how it makes web pages bloated (way to visualize)


### What did I do?

1. scraped selected websites with know "suggested content" on them for 30 days, the more absurd, the better
2. 1 purpose: wanted to work with web archiving of fragments - Developed a process for "archiving this content"
3. 2 purpose: Wanted to make the resource available to others (for research?) e.g., what content comes up at what times (correlation with news stories?)

#### ABSURD WARC

- SIP -> AIP -> DIP METS file. It's a bit of absurdist archiving.
- Gaps in web archiving, ephemera trash the absurd boundaries of knowledge and information
- Exercise in preparing a dataset for reaserchers from archived web content
- Need to determine if WARC tools are capturing this.
- Need to know everything someone (me) would want to have now bc going back to hydrate might not be possible
- capture cookie information as part of the SIP
- would want to analyze how these services differ between each other and how they themselves change over time
- WARC fragments
- WARC for page found on and page on and page linked to (but so much is slideshow multi page sites - Need a web archiving service with an API)

[BUT WHY THO?]

#### PRESENTATION, INVITING OTHERS
- An exhibit resource (gallery) drawing connections btw items. Ways to grab subjects or topic modeling for things (food, celebrities, health, crime, sex, sex)
- A microcosm of the internet itself, the extreme end if "content". This is the distilled result of these companies best guess of what will draw attention.
- "As a discourse, it's watching machines and reptilian minded marketing initiatives talking to sometime the interests of a specific user (cookies) or perhaps the basest desires of a composite sketch of your average web user."
- probably have a little bit of analysis on what is already there (PT.2)
- provide access to data
- in all reality as much as I'd like this to be research, this is probably heading towards being some Dada bot
