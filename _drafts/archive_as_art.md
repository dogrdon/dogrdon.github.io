###Encountering An Archive in Public

Recently taking a trip to the 2014 Whitney Biennial, I was drawn in by [a piece](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JosephGrigely "Whitney Biennial 2014 Joseph Grigely, The Gregory Battcock Archive, 2009-2014") prepared by Joseph Grigely and Rebecca Morris, which consists of archival materials from the Painter turned Art Critic and Historian [Gregory Battcock](http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/battcockg.htm). Battcock, it would seem not trivial to mention, was found abruptly and "unsolvably" [murdered](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19801227&id=FVRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8wkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3185,7689250) on Christmas day, 1980.

<a href="http://www.thevisualist.org/2009/12/joseph-grigley-the-gregory-battcock-archive/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a little more background and rumination on the narrative intent of exhibiting this archive, though my focus is more at the broad scope of archives embedded as public displays in museums. I don't mean to be so "gee-golly" about it. It's just something that I think is an interesting turn in museum curation.

###Encountering the Archive in Public

I am skeptical of contemporary-art, for reasons that are beyond this post. That said, I found that this work was a good example of what makes for an interesting work of art. It accomplished what I think is an important function of a work of art: it compelled me to see something differently ("what are other instances of archival materials in the museum as such and not as evidence of a larger exhibit"), it brought attention to something I was not aware of (namely, Gregory Battcock), it dialed in a channel I was not tuned into previously, namely that the Archive should be out in the open, for more than just the researcher and the subject enthusiast to view.

Beyond these impressions, It brought up questions of metaart (or rather art about art, or the supporting materials for an artists art), who is the artist (or rather who or what is the agent in this instance conveying the most significance: Grigley's selection? Battcock's oeuvre, the latter's tragic end?) and, as I'll get into below, what deserves to be preserved and what preserved objects are interesting to a public audience?

###The Archive as Such

I am generally taken by Archives (it is what brought me to study information science in the first place, even if I did not follow through fully on that practice). The space inside of archives is process and thought laid bare and rough: Hand sketched ideas begetting the final product, photographs that accompany ideas or document the context of those ideas. They allow one to plumb the depths of someone's work.

Archives are also a work of archaeology: A discovery of artifacts that connect a hypothesis about how one lived and worked to the evidence of that life, the detritus of a practice that is under examination.

Particularly with the Battcock Archive display, with its manuscripts, file folders, postcards and photographs, there is a compelling in the intimate and personal possessions. I am also a stationary junkie, and to see folders and old postcards laid out accentuating the details how the owner chose to label their tabs, doodle or fill in their message partitions, I am thrilled by the vital and quotidian connection to an artist's process.

###The Archive as Art and Preservation Concerns

In a large way, Archives are a crucial view into the creative process of an artist (or anyone who is important enough to have an archive) that transcends the production and machinations of purposeful artistic representation. What I am trying to say is that it is quite pure. The Archive as art is an interesting statement. Aside from what is said of narrative and storytelling. It strikes me more like a natural formation. The slow and almost guileless creation of artifacts that one, at their time of creation, does not consider that they will ever reach the public. They are the drafts and the sketchs and the doodles and that contribute to an creators work, but they are never intended to be the final project, the object of admiration themselves.

Though what struck me while viewing this exhibit is the lingering fear that more and more where work is done digitally, on less reliable storage media than paper, artistic process is more ephemeral and less telling perhaps when caught in the digital. And I began to wonder how we might capture process as work becomes more digital. With digital tools at hand, we can capture more and we can also produce more, but as the barrier to producing more lowers, it's easier for us as creators to throw whatever we'd like out or in there and the process of selection is less apparent or obvious.

###The Future of The Archive as Public Spectacle

So the original thought that brought me to write this and meander through the above is: What does the public exhibition of the Archive look like in the future (which is a question, at this point, not entirely separated from what the archive, in general, looks like in the future). My assumption here is that more and more work takes place digitally. We are now at a point where [notebooks are a bit of an affectation](http://www.moleskine.com/) in a world of [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and [Google Keep](https://drive.google.com/keep) (amongst any number of additional apps with their own particular data structures and policies for export).

So how to we display the digital sketchs and notes left by an artist? Do we share personal harddrives connected to monitors with an interactive display? Do we allow museum patrons to browse diffs for edits in seminal works of an author (I am reminded of [this](http://benfry.com/traces/) amazing visualization of edits to Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species by Ben Fry)? Establish a flickr stream of all an artists personal photographs? Create interactive display for browsing the structured data pulled from any number of apps that have come and gone through the course of an artist's working life?

Some of this might suggest a need for more data science in the archive. Though that is not a recommendation. Though increasingly, it seems, we are in need of capturing the ephemera of a person's production as a way to understand their work. And not only with more and more preparation work being done digitally, but also with the ease with which digital tools allow us to proliferate the notes and thoughts we record (some, if not most of it, unintentionally through digital commiunication), we will have to consider the depths to which facility with handling digital media will bear on the future understanding of the ideas and meaning that shape our culture.
