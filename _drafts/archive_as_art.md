###Encountering An Archive in Public

Recently taking a trip to the Whitney Biennial, I was drawn in by [a piece](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JosephGrigely "Whitney Biennial 2014 Joseph Grigely, The Gregory Battcock Archive, 2009-2014") prepared by Joseph Grigely and Rebecca Morris consisting of archival materials from the Painter turned Art Critic and Historian [Gregory Battcock](http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/battcockg.htm). Battcock, it would seem not trivial to mention, was found abruptly and "unsolvably" [murdered](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19801227&id=FVRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8wkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3185,7689250) on Christmas day, 1980.

<a href="http://www.thevisualist.org/2009/12/joseph-grigley-the-gregory-battcock-archive/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a little more background and rumination on the narrative intent of exhibiting this archive, though my focus is more at the broad scope of archives embedded as public displays in museums. I don't mean to be so "gee-golly" about it. It's just something that I think is an interesting turn in museum curation.

###Encountering the Archive in Public

I am a contemporary-art skeptic, for reasons that are beyond this post. That sai, I found that this work was a good example of what makes for an interesting exhibit. It brought up questions of metaart, preservation, who is the artist (or rather who or what is the agent in this instance conveying the most significance: Grigley's selection? Battcock's oeuvre, the latter's tragic end?).

Beyond these questions, it accomplished what I think is a primary function of a work of art: it compelled me to see something differently, it brought attention to something I was not aware of, dialed in a channel I was not tuned into previously, namely that the Archive should be out in the open, for more than just the researcher and the subject enthusiast to view. |||In the days to follow I begin to find other examples (?) of archives employed in artistic settings (as the object itself).|||

###The Archive as Such

I am generally taken by Archives (it is what brought me to study information science in the first place). The space inside of which is process and thought laid bare in all its roughness. Hand sketched ideas, photographs that accompany ideas that were meant for text, allow one to see the depth of someone's work. I am also a stationary junkie, and to see folders and old postcards laid out to accentuate the fine intricacies of how the owner chose to label their tabs, doodle or fill in their message partitions, I am thrilled by the vital and quotidian connection to someone's process. To see how one used their pen, how they organized their photos. The experience is entirely subjective, sure, but what effort of appreciation isn't, in some small way?

Archives are also a work of archaeology: A discovery of artifacts that connect a hypothesis about how one lived to the evidence of that live, the detritus of a practice that is under examination.

###The Archive as Art

In a large way, Archives are a crucial view into the creative process of an artist (or anyone who is important enough to have an archive) that transcends the production and machinations of purposeful artistic representation. What I am saying is it is quite pure. Though what struck me while viewing this exhibit is the lingering fear that more and more, artistic process is more ephemeral and less telling perhaps when caught in the digital. And I began to wonder how we might capture process as work becomes more digital. With digital tools at hand, we can capture more, but we can also produce more, and as the barrier to producing more lowers, it's easier for us as creators to throw whatever out there and the process of selection is watered down.

The Archive as art was a beautiful statement. Aside from what is said of narrative and storytelling. It strikes me more like a natural formation. The slow and almost guileless creation of artifacts that one, at their time of creation, does not consider that they will ever reach the public. They are the drafts and the sketchs and the doodles and that contribute to an creators work, but they are never intended to be the final project, the object of admiration themselves.


###The Future of The Archive as Public Spectacle
So the original thought of this exposition was: What does the public exhibition of the Archive look like in the future (which is a question, at this point, not entirely separated from what the archive, in general, looks like in the future). My assumption here is that more and more work takes place digitally. Notebooks are an affectation in a world of [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and [Google Keep](https://drive.google.com/keep) (amongst any number of additional apps with their own particular data structures and policies for export).

Do we share personal harddrives connected to monitors with an interactive display? Do we allow museum patrons to browse diffs for edits in seminal works of an author? Establish a flickr stream of all an artists personal photographs? Create interactive display for browsing the structured data pulled from any number of apps that have come and gone through the course of an artist's working life?

Some of this might suggest a need for more data science in the archive. Though that is not a recommendation. Though increasingly, it seems, we are in need of capturing the ephemera of a person's production as a way to understand their work. And not only with more and more preparation work being done digitally, but also with the ease with which digital tools allow us to proliferate the notes and thoughts we record (some, if not most of it, unintentionally through digital commiunication), we will have to consider the depths to which facility with handling digital media will bear on the future understanding of the ideas and meaning that shape our culture.
