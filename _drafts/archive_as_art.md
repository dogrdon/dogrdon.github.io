###Encountering An Archive in a Museum

Recently taking a trip to the 2014 Whitney Biennial, I was drawn in by [a piece](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JosephGrigely "Whitney Biennial 2014 Joseph Grigely, The Gregory Battcock Archive, 2009-2014") prepared by Joseph Grigely and Rebecca Morris, which consists of archival materials from the Painter turned Art Critic and Historian [Gregory Battcock](http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/battcockg.htm). Battcock, it is not trivial to mention, was found abruptly and "unsolvably" [murdered](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19801227&id=FVRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8wkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3185,7689250) on Christmas day, 1980.

<a href="http://www.thevisualist.org/2009/12/joseph-grigley-the-gregory-battcock-archive/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a little more background and rumination on the narrative intent of exhibiting this archive, though my focus is more at the broad scope of archives embedded as public displays in museums. While this is not a new or rare approach, I think it is an interesting trend in museum curation.

###Encountering the Archive

I am skeptical of contemporary-art for reasons that are beyond this post. That said, I found that this piece accomplished what I think is an important function of a work of art: it compelled me to see something differently ("what are other instances of archival materials in the museum as such and not as evidence of a larger exhibit?"); it brought attention to something I was not aware of (namely, Gregory Battcock); it tuned in a channel I was not tuned into previously, namely that the Archive should be out in the open, for more than just the researcher and the subject enthusiast to view.

Beyond these impressions, It brought with it questions of meta-art (or whatever you might call art about art or artists), who is the artist (or rather what is the agent conveying the most significance in this instance: Grigley's selection? Battcock's oeuvre? the latter's tragic end?)?, and, as I'll pursue below, what can be preserved and what preserved objects are interesting to a public audience?

###The Archive as Such

The Archival space is process and thought laid bare and rough. It is where we find objects like the written notes or quick sketches begetting the final product, the photographs and private communications that accompany ideas or document the context of those ideas. They give background to respected cultural works, allowing us to plumb the depths of an artists work.

Archives are a work of archaeology, the uncovered artifacts that shore up a hypothesis about how one lived and worked, the detritus of an artistic practice that sometimes attempts to cover up the biographical tracks back to its creator.

In a significant way, Archives are a crucial view into the creative process of an artist (or anyone who is important enough to have an archive) that transcends the production and machinations of purposeful artistic representation. Aside from what is said of narrative and storytelling, it strikes me more like a natural formation. The slow, guileless accumulation of personal artifacts never intended to touch the public in the same way the final work of art is intended too.

###The Archive as Art and Preservation Concerns

Though what struck me while viewing this exhibit is the lingering fear that more and more where work is done digitally - on less reliable storage media than paper - artistic process might become more ephemeral and less telling, less revealing. And I began to wonder how we might capture process as work becomes more digital. With digital tools at hand, we can capture more and we can also produce more, but as the barrier to producing more lowers, it's easier for us as creators to throw whatever we'd like out or in there and the process of selecting and discerning might become less apparent or obvious.

###The Future of The Archive as Public Spectacle

So the original thought that brought me to write this and meander through the above is: What does the public exhibition of the Archive look like in the future (which is a question, at this point, not entirely separated from what the archive, in general, looks like in the future). We are now at a point where [notebooks are a bit of an affectation](http://www.moleskine.com/) in a world of [Evernote](https://evernote.com) and [Google Keep](https://drive.google.com/keep) (amongst any number of additional apps with their own particular data structures and policies for export).

So how to we display the digital sketchs and notes left by an artist? Do we share personal harddrives connected to monitors with an interactive display? Do we allow museum patrons to browse diffs for edits in seminal works of an author (I am reminded of [this](http://benfry.com/traces/) amazing visualization of edits to Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species by Ben Fry)? Establish a flickr stream of all an artists personal photographs? Create interactive display for browsing the structured data pulled from any number of apps that have come and gone through the course of an artist's working life?

Some of this might suggest a need for more data science in the archive. I am not recommending a complete replacement of Archival professionals with data scientists. Though being able to manipulate and communicate large sets of digital information will be crucial for the future of narrating this space. <And while not all archives will need such a treatment, if we are to consider the communication of these aspects in a meaningful way, we need to make sure this capacity is provided for where public interest, and artistic expression meets the archive.>
