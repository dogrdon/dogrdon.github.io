title: "Analysis of the Entartete Kunst Datenbank"
description: "The Nazi's attempt to control and or destroy the art they found to be degenarte resulted in a very meticulous documentation of that artwork. The Free Universiyt of Berlin has undertaken the process of turning the Nazi bookkeeping into a publically accessible database. I took a pass at collecting that data into a workable form and visualizing it. This is in edition to having visited the Neue Galeries exhibitio n of some of those recovered works."

*This first came to my attention when I saw [this](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/entartete-kunst/) announcement that the Victoria and Albert Museum had made a digital, browse-able copy of the book the Nazi's kept in their program to annihilate European works of art they considered to be 'degenarate'.

*It got me thinking how interesting it might be to do some quick data analysis to summarize the contents of this well-structured data (I hate to give any credit to the Nazis, but in their bookkeeping, they are meticulous). Without some pretty heavy duty OCR and a ton of money, making these images machine readable was not in the cards for me.

*I was pleased to find, however, that the Free University of Berlin hand undertaken a project to compile the information in these pages into an online, searchable database complete with full metadata (where available) for each work of art as well as the status and current location (much of it was destroyed, which is discussed below). It is not a complete database and as of April 24, 2014 has only 10,34_ records of a total ____

*Summary of the database
  -EK Inventory corresponds to the Nazi Inventory number, the primary key.

*This post only goes so deep in it's visualization. This is a pretty massive topic and really getting at the core of it would require a deep understanding of this point in history, this point in art history, much more information of the biographics these artists and other such details that are not at my disposal as a hobbyist of degenarate art databases.

*Also, I apologize if collecting this data was somehow problematic. I do not claim to own it and do not have intent to use this data for commercial gain. It is my hope that wrangling this data for this blog post is, if anything, a good promotion for the database itself and welcome any inquiries, notes of admonishment or cease and desist to the e-mail below.
