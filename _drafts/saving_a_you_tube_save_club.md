* saving a bunch of youtube faves from 200X - 200X and destroyed in 2010?
* evidence of what exists, rebuilding it
* significance they had of a shared curation of youtube videos
* how many remain,
* what happened to the others, an analysis.
* the act of favoriting things
* cultural memory
* trying to salvage a practice between people
* others do this, maybe not in this manner
* using social media as a place to store emotions and memories you don't have time to process now
* I can't perform in public,
* favoriting and passive social media as a practice, a cultural practice
* synthesize quick and move on
* context of watching
* twitter is not my favorite, but every now and again it's useful/helpul

process:

where do i start,
	- have an html page saved so I have title, youtube id, user that :uploaded? 
	- get that into a database (mongo, whatever, I guess an html file is just mongo anyway)
	- figure out what is viable and what's not
	- can also tell about what "happened" to user (link is alive or not, can't get real disposition)
	- download all of them, 
	- "recreate" page
	- What was the point?
	- Couldn't get started because too busy clicking through it, seeing what was still left, like opening a shoebox after many years.

How, 
	- pafy
	- youtube-dl

What, 
	154 videos total, 
	116 still up, 
	38 down

	when to download, 
	when to update metadata, 
	what implications for other uses, 
	what ideas for monitoring/protecting youtube uploads from going away?
	what workflows for protecting youtube videos once you've shared/favorited or otherwise marked it.
