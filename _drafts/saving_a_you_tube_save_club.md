* saving a bunch of youtube faves from 200X - 200X and destroyed in 2010?
* evidence of what exists, rebuilding it
* significance they had of a shared curation of youtube videos
* how many remain,
* what happened to the others, an analysis.
* the act of favoriting things
* cultural memory
* trying to salvage a practice between people
* others do this, maybe not in this manner
* using social media as a place to store emotions and memories you don't have time to process now
* I can't perform in public,
* favoriting and passive social media as a practice, a cultural practice
* synthesize quick and move on
* context of watching
* twitter is not my favorite, but every now and again it's useful/helpul

process:

where do i start,
	- have an html page saved so I have title, youtube id, user that :uploaded? 
	- get that into a database (mongo, whatever, I guess an html file is just mongo anyway)
	- figure out what is viable and what's not
	- can also tell about what "happened" to user (link is alive or not, can't get real disposition)
	- download all of them, 
	- "recreate" page
	- What was the point?
	- Couldn't get started because too busy clicking through it, seeing what was still left, like opening a shoebox after many years.

How, 
	- pafy
	- youtube-dl

What, 
	- 154 videos total, 
	- 116 still up, 
	- 38 down

	- after remediation: 23 videos could be recovered while 15 appear to be lost to the ages
		for a number of reasons:
			- not enough details, very vague or unspecific metadata
			- many copies of something similar, but decidedly not the original either by memory or because length of video
			- some interesting phenomena. B4-4 Get Down appears to be widely mocked, but there is no unadulterated remaining copy of the video (some joker on vimeo introducing it). It is available, but not in this country. I would hate to be that legal team.
			- 10 accounts removed for multiple copyright violations
			- 4 copyright blocks on the content
			- 2 accounts terminated
			- 1 video in violation of YT terms of service
			- 3 videos private and
			- 18 videos marked simply as unavailable (sorry)
			- 11 users deleted because of multiple copyright claims
			- 2 users deleted because of repeated or sever violations and or copyright claims
			- 18 users are still live (or at least the usernames are)
			- 7 users just do not exist

	- when to download, 
	- when to update metadata, 
	- what implications for other uses, 
	- what ideas for monitoring/protecting youtube uploads from going away?
	- what workflows for protecting youtube videos once you've shared/favorited or otherwise marked it.

Next steps, 
	- separate the available from the unavailable
	- go find out if there is another copy of the unavailable
	- go find out what happened to the user
	- enter the new vid and user disposition into the database
	- download all videos
	- resurrect the youtube channel
	- create a check for the playlist itself (or the database)
		- make sure all vids are still available
		- mark any that have become unavailable
		- normalize?
		- clean up and keep checking
		- what to do about things that have gotten lost between checks?

Lessons learned...

- a bit of a preamble: this is not preservation in the professional, expert sense. This is more like backing up. But I think what's important to emphasize here is that this is also not related to backing up one's own uploads and work. That's a solution that Google already provides [takeout]. But what about the interaction, culture importance of a selection of videos. A curated list of videos, these are well more fragile and ephemeral because they draw from a number of creators, quickly a playlist can become shot through with copyright infringement takedowns, closed accounts, so on and so forth. There is also an ephemerality to videos that were not put up with much effort, loss or no metadat to begin with, shoddy titles. But the work underneath still points at something, conveys some meaning, and having found it under the rubble is a bit of an accomplishment. How do we somehow save these moments, with as much context and understandability as is allowed by the original upload?

Conclusions
- Some examples have been provided here with backups found elsewhere. Though I cannot garuantee that even these measures will ensure preservation. Though I do think that when it comes to matters of digital preservation, we can't wait for the digital content platforms or even the institutions that have digital preservation as a mission to support the saving of our cultural artifacts. Specifically the ones that lack political and historical power. The ephemera will get lost, as it usually does. But with the web we can begin to take a stance on preservation of the things we like the most. And hope that the infrastructure comes around that not only helps us collect digital media, but to preserve if for later enjoyment and the narration of our selves (or whatever)
