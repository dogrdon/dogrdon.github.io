Recently taking a trip to the Whitney Biennial, I got drawn in by [a piece](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial/JosephGrigely "Whitney Biennial 2014 Joseph Grigely, The Gregory Battcock Archive, 2009-2014") prepared by Joseph Grigely and Rebecca Morris consisting of archival materials from the Painter turned Art Critic and Historian Gregory Battcock.

I am a contemporary art skeptic, for reasons that are beyond this post. Though I found that this work to be a good example of makes for an interesting exhibit. It brought up all kinds of questions of metaart, preservation, who is an artist. It also accomplished what I think is a primary function of a work of art, encouraged me to see something differently, it brought attention to something I was not aware of, clicked me over to a channel I was not tuned into previously, namely that the Archive should be out in the open, for more than just the researcher and the enthusiast to view. In the days to follow I begin to find other examples (?) of archives employed in artistic settings (as the object itself).

I have always been taken by Archives (it is what brought me to study information science in the first place), in which is laid bare process and roughness, hand sketched ideas, photographs that accompany ideas that were meant for text, to see the depth of someone's work. I am also a stationary junkie, and to see folders and old postcards laid out with the the fine intricacies of how the subject chose to label their tabs, or fill in their blank sections, I am granted a vital connection through the quotidian to someone else. To see how one used their pen, how they organized their photos. The experience is entirely subjective, sure, but what effort of appreciation isn't, in some small way?

The Archive as art was a beautiful statement. Aside from what is said of narrative and storytelling. It strikes me more like a natural formation. The slow and almost guileless creation of artifacts that one, at their time of creation, does not consider that they will ever reach the public. They are the drafts and the sketchs and the doodles and that contribute to an creators work, but they are never intended to be the final project, the object of admiration themselves.

In a large way, Archives are a crucial view into the creative process of the artist that transcends the production and machinations of purposeful artistic representation. What I am saying is it is quite pure. Though what struck me while viewing this exhibit is the lingering fear that more and more, artistic process is more ephemeral and less telling perhaps when caught in the digital. And I began to wonder how we might capture process as work becomes more digital. With digital tools at hand, we can capture more, but we can also produce more, and as the barrier to producing more lowers, it's easier for us as creators to throw whatever out there and the process of selection is watered down.
