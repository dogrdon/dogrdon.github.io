Recently took a trip to the Whitney Biennial and got drawn in by a piece based on the archives of Art Historian Gregory Battcock, who was brutally murdered in 1980.

Ever skeptical of contemporary art, I found this to be a perfect example of what art can do today. It brought up all kinds of questions of metaart, preservation, who is an artist.

I have always been taken by Archives, in which is laid bare process and roughness, hand sketched ideas, photographs that accompany ideas that were meant for text, to see the depth of someone's work.

The Archive as art was a beautiful statement. And then I had a sad thinking about how we might capture process as work becomes more digital. We can capture more, but we can also produce more, and as the barrier to producing more lowers, it's easier for us as creators to throw whatever out there adn the process of selection is watered down.
