I'd recently been sent a copy Linked Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums and felt this could use a review. 

Though I work in a library setting and have sat down with linked data concepts and examples a few times already, I don't use it outright in my day to day and I admitedly have struggled with what Linked Data exactly is and how to implement some of its practices in the work I do. 

This book is a welcome addition to the literature on the concept of Linked Data and particularly in a Library, Archives and Museum's setting, where I feel it is discussed the most but not exactly practiced widely or in any sustainable fashion. 

As mentioned above, I've had fleeting interactions with Linked Data in the past, but I've always found it a bit unwieldy or a little abstract and difficult to translate into real data practices. Coming from an 'Open Data' background, I can appreciate the process of linking datasets and concepts across datasets, but when CSV, JSON and *SQL databases are more of what you are used to, trying to wrap your mind around RDF/XML, SKOS, and SPARQL can be a little difficult.

One of the stopping points for me was in all of these additional acronyms and the lack of comprehensive documentation around them. Yes, okay, RDF is ____ and it does ____, and SKOS is _____ and it does _____ and SPARQL is a query language for linked datasets. Fine. But it felt like trying to grapple with these concepts was a challange because they were all self referencing and seemed to have emerged out of a vacum to forum the Linked Data-tron.

Linked Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums understands this challenge that I think a lot of information practitioners might grapple with in trying to see how Linked Data works and what benefit it might have for their organization. 

Not only does it break down linked data practices as an overall process of working with a dataset from soup to nuts (the chapters are outlined in a fashion such that you can start with a non-linked dataset and process it to the point where you can publish on the web), but it adds a historical context for these metadata schemas and how they relate to other metadata schemas both inside the LAM setting but also outside to more general computer science, data professional concerns.

Framing it within the history of how the web started, it's aspirations to be 'semantic', and the history of classifications systems allowed for a discussion of the current status of Linked Data, what it hopes to accomplish given the past of information management in cultural institutions and where it might fallshort or still have yet to go.
